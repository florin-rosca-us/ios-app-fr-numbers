# Count With Me
Teach toddlers numbers from 1 to 10 using your voice.

Toddlers seem to enjoy swiping back and forth on phones and tablets, but they always seem to be able to reach the phone's settings and mess it up.
Even with "Guided Access" mode on, if the app has any configuration settings, they will reach that too.
